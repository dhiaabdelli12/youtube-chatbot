# French Keywords Extraction

This repository contains code for fine-tuning CamemBERT for French keywords extraction

## Datasets 

The datasets are available in the `data` folder. 

- `final-keys-dataset.csv`: This dataset contains the final dataset used for training and validation. It contains 2 columns: `text`, and `keywords`. The dataset collected from transcribed YouTube videos is merged with WikiNews french keywords dataset for data augmentation. The dataset contains ~340 documents.
- `PAWS-C-FR`: This folder contains the PAWS-X french dataset used for pre-fine-tuning CamemBERT on Sentences similiary task. The dataset contains 3 files: `translated_train.tsv`, `test_2k.tsv`, and `dev_2k`. Each file contains 3 columns: `id`, `sentence1`, and `sentence2`. The `sentence1` column contains the first sentence, the `sentence2` column contains the second sentence, and the `label` column contains the label (0 or 1). 


## Notebooks 

This repository contains the following notebooks:

- `finetuning.ipynb`: This notebook contains code for fine-tuning CamemBERT for French keywords extraction.
- `prefinetuning.ipynb`: This notebook contains code for pre-fine-tuning CamemBERT on Sentences Similarity task using PAWS-C french dataset.
